How to make a system stackful:

(1) Determine what the frame pointer is on that platform and whether it's
    caller- or callee-saved.

(2) Change the register count and map on the target system to move the frame
    pointer out of the typical map and to location NUMBER_OF_REGISTERS + 2. Note
    that this usually also involves moving the temporary registers up.

(3) Modify emit_enter and emit_return (in the latter case, typically via
    emit_frame_release) to

    (a) Save the frame pointer while it's saving other registers. Look for
        GET_SAVED_REGISTERS_SIZE in particular.

    (b) Set the frame pointer equal to the stack pointer when it's done

    (c) Reset the stack pointer based on the frame pointer in the epilogue

    (d) Restore the frame pointer while restoring other registers

(4) Implement sljit_emit_alloca, sljit_set_alloca, and sljit_emit_pop.

(5) If applicable, fix up virtual registers to work from the frame pointer
    instead of the stack pointer.
